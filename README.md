Brick Breaker is a classic arcade game implemented in Java. The game involves breaking a wall of bricks using a ball and a paddle. The objective is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle. This game showcases the use of Java's built-in graphics and user input handling libraries to create an engaging gaming experience.

## Features

- Keep the ball from falling below the paddle to maintain gameplay.
- Win by clearing all the bricks or lose if the ball falls below the paddle.
- Restart the game by pressing the "Enter" key after a win or loss.
